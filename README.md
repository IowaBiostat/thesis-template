This repo provides a template for writing a LaTeX thesis that conforms to University of Iowa formatting guidelines.

## Getting started

To get started, either clone this repository (this will create a folder on your computer called `my-awesome-thesis` or whatever you want to call it):

```
git clone git@github.com:IowaBiostat/thesis-template.git my-awesome-thesis
```

Alternatively, you can download the [zip file](https://github.com/IowaBiostat/thesis-template/archive/master.zip) and extract the files.

## Building the document

After downloading/cloning, you should be able to run `pdflatex` on `thesis.tex`.  This template uses `natbib` to handle references, so you will also have to run `bibtex` to update all the references.  If you don't already have a reference manager for LaTeX, I suggest using [JabRef](https://www.jabref.org]) -- it's excellent.

## Contributing

If any guidelines have changed and the style file needs modified, please let me know!

Last known student to use this template and have his/her thesis pass inspection with the Graduate College: Biyue Dai (December, 2019).
